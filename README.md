# REFLECTIONS ON LIFE AND PURSUIT OF MIRRORED SURFACES

A big ol mess of testing real-time mirror reflections in unity using a two-camera arrangement... hacky, janky, but it looks pretty and could be useful in some situations.

Almost entirely un-documented, hacky janky mess as stated, use at your own risk, etc 

Last run with Unity 2020.1
